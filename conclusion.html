        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            Food recognition using computer vision has made significant strides in recent years, driven by advancements in deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This tutorial reviewed several cutting-edge techniques, from Kagaya et al.'s pioneering work on CNN-based food detection to more modern approaches integrating segmentation and portion estimation, as discussed by Ye He et al.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of large-scale datasets such as Food-101 has further enabled researchers to train models that can classify diverse food items with increasing accuracy. Despite the progress, challenges remain, especially in real-world applications where varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and the presentation of food can affect recognition performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we look toward the future, it is clear that the integration of computer vision into dietary tracking, health monitoring, and restaurant services holds immense potential. However, more work is needed to improve model robustness, real-time processing, and cross-cultural food diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, food recognition through computer vision is a promising field that blends cutting-edge AI technology with practical applications in healthcare, nutrition, and beyond. By continuing to refine these algorithms and expanding the scope of data collection, we can look forward to more accurate, efficient, and widely applicable solutions in the years ahead.
