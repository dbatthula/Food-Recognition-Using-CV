        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            Food recognition using computer vision has made significant strides in recent years, driven by advancements in deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This tutorial reviewed several cutting-edge techniques, from Kagaya et al.'s pioneering work on CNN-based food detection to more modern approaches integrating segmentation and portion estimation, as discussed by Ye He et al.
        </p>
        <p>
            The development of large-scale datasets such as Food-101 has further enabled researchers to train models that can classify diverse food items with increasing accuracy. Despite the progress, challenges remain, especially in real-world applications where varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and the presentation of food can affect recognition performance.
        </p>

        <!-- New paragraph on CNN drawbacks -->
        <p>
            While CNNs have proven effective in food recognition, they are not without their limitations. One of the primary drawbacks is the computational cost associated with training and deploying deep CNN models. The large number of layers and parameters makes them resource-intensive, often requiring high-end hardware such as GPUs for both training and real-time inference. Additionally, CNNs can struggle with food images that involve complex presentations, where food items may be occluded or mixed, leading to classification errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            CNNs also tend to require large labeled datasets to perform well. In many real-world applications, obtaining large amounts of annotated data can be challenging, especially for niche or culturally specific food items. This reliance on extensive datasets can limit the generalizability of CNN-based models to diverse food types or presentations.
        </p>

        <p>
            As we look toward the future, it is clear that the integration of computer vision into dietary tracking, health monitoring, and restaurant services holds immense potential. However, more work is needed to improve model robustness, real-time processing, and cross-cultural food diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, food recognition through computer vision is a promising field that blends cutting-edge AI technology with practical applications in healthcare, nutrition, and beyond. By continuing to refine these algorithms and expanding the scope of data collection, we can look forward to more accurate, efficient, and widely applicable solutions in the years ahead.
        </p>
