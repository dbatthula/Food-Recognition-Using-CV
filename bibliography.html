        <h2>[1] Hokuto Kagaya, Kiyoharu Aizawa, and Makoto Ogawa, “Food Detection and Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network”, ACM International Conference, November 2014</h2>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This paper introduces an early application of CNNs to food recognition, using the UEC-Food100 dataset. The study demonstrates a convolutional architecture capable of classifying food categories with an accuracy of 72.26%. It also emphasizes how deep learning can be adapted to food detection, even with complex visual features.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Published by ACM, a leading conference in computing research, this paper is a reliable source. The authors are established researchers in computer vision and multimedia analysis.</p>

        <h2>[2] Ye He, Chang Xu, Nitin Khanna, Carol J. Boushey, and Edward J. Delp, “Food Image Analysis: Segmentation, Identification, and Weight Estimation”, IEEE, July 2013</h2>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This research focuses on segmenting food images to identify individual items and estimate their portion size and caloric content. The paper introduces semantic segmentation techniques combined with volumetric models for dietary applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Published by IEEE, this work is well-regarded, and the authors have considerable expertise in image analysis, health, and nutrition research. It is highly relevant for food recognition applications in dietary logging and health monitoring.</p>

        <h2>[3] Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin, and Luc Van Gool, “Food-101 – Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests”, ECCV, 2014</h2>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This paper introduces the Food-101 dataset, consisting of 101,000 food images across 101 categories. The authors used Random Forest classifiers to mine discriminative features and achieved competitive results on this large-scale dataset.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Published in ECCV, one of the premier conferences in computer vision, this paper is a foundational work in food recognition research and provides a high-quality, openly available dataset.</p>

        <h2>[4] Jie Yang, Ming Yang, and Yang Liu, “Food Recognition Using Image Processing and Convolutional Neural Networks”, IEEE Access, 2018</h2>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This paper builds on CNN-based food recognition techniques and proposes an efficient model architecture optimized for mobile devices. The research focuses on balancing performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in dietary tracking.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> IEEE Access is a peer-reviewed journal with a broad scope. This paper is valuable for understanding the challenges of applying CNNs to mobile platforms, and the authors have expertise in deep learning and embedded systems.</p>

        <h2>[5] Lukas Bossard et al., “Food-101 Dataset and Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks”, Data in Brief, 2014</h2>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> This article provides a comprehensive description of the Food-101 dataset, detailing its construction and characteristics. It is widely used for benchmarking food classification models in computer vision.</p>
        <p><strong>Reliability:</strong> Published by “Data in Brief,” this dataset article complements the technical study by Lukas Bossard et al., providing open access to the Food-101 dataset for researchers.</p>
