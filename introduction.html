        <h1>Introduction to Food Recognition Using Computer Vision</h1>
        <p>Food recognition is a growing field in computer vision that focuses on the automatic detection and classification of food items from images. 
           Advances in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have enabled researchers to develop highly accurate models for food recognition.</p>

        <p>The applications of food recognition are diverse, ranging from diet tracking and calorie estimation to food logging for medical purposes. 
           The increasing availability of large food datasets and advancements in image processing techniques have opened new opportunities for solving real-world challenges in health, nutrition, and well-being.</p>

        <h2>Why Food Recognition?</h2>
        <p>Accurate food recognition can revolutionize how we monitor and understand our eating habits. 
           It plays a crucial role in mobile applications, helping users track their dietary intake by automatically recognizing food items in photos. 
           Furthermore, food recognition systems can be used to analyze eating patterns and offer insights into health risks such as obesity and diabetes.</p>

        <h2>Deep Learning in Food Recognition</h2>
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the go-to technique for image recognition tasks, including food classification. 
           CNNs are capable of automatically learning features from food images, such as shape, color, and texture, which are then used to classify the food items. 
           With deeper layers, CNNs can capture intricate details, enabling them to differentiate between visually similar food types, such as different types of pasta or sushi.</p>
