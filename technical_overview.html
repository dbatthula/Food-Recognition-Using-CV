        <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Food Recognition</h2>
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a deep learning method widely used for tasks like image classification, object detection, and feature extraction. CNNs are particularly effective in handling image data due to their deep structure and the convolution process, which allows for object detection in various domains, including food classification.</p>
        <p>CNNs are composed of two main parts: the feature extraction layer and the fully connected layer.</p>
        <h3>Convolution Layer</h3>
        <p>This layer detects patterns in the image by applying filters to the input image. For instance, in a CNN architecture, a filter slides over the image, multiplying corresponding pixel values to detect textures and edges.</p>

        <h3>Pooling Layer</h3>
        <p>Following convolution, the pooling layer reduces the size of the data by partitioning it and selecting the maximum value from each section (max-pooling), simplifying the data while retaining important features.</p>

        <h3>Fully Connected Layer</h3>
        <p>At the end, this layer combines all the features from the previous layers and uses a softmax function to classify the object based on probability.</p>

        <h3>CNN Application in Food Recognition</h3>
        <p>In food recognition, CNNs can be used to classify images of dishes by processing images under consistent conditions like brightness and distance. For example, a dataset could include foods like rice, fried chicken, and tofu, captured in uniform settings for accurate analysis.</p>
