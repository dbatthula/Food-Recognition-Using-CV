        <h1>Technical Overview</h1>

        <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h2>
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the backbone of modern food recognition systems. CNNs automatically learn hierarchical features from images, such as edges, textures, and more complex patterns, which make them ideal for recognizing various food items in images.</p>
        <p>CNNs consist of several layers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Convolutional Layers:</strong> Extract low-level features like edges, corners, and textures.</li>
            <li><strong>Pooling Layers:</strong> Reduce the spatial dimensions of the data to focus on the most prominent features while maintaining important information.</li>
            <li><strong>Fully Connected Layers:</strong> Perform classification tasks by mapping features to specific labels (e.g., food items).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Datasets for Food Recognition</h2>
        <p>Training CNNs for food recognition requires large, labeled datasets of food images. Some widely used datasets include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Food-101:</strong> Contains 101,000 images of 101 food categories. It's one of the largest datasets used for food classification tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>UEC Food-256:</strong> Contains 256 different types of Japanese food and is used for more detailed segmentation tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>VIREO Food-172:</strong> Specializes in Chinese food with 172 food categories, providing diversity in food culture and representation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Food Image Segmentation</h2>
        <p>Segmentation in food recognition refers to the process of isolating individual food items within an image, which is essential for multi-item food classification and portion estimation. Techniques such as semantic segmentation help identify the boundaries of food items, which can then be passed to classification algorithms for further analysis.</p>

        <h2>Classification and Identification</h2>
        <p>Once segmented, food images are passed through a classification network, where CNNs map extracted features to predefined food categories. State-of-the-art models such as **Faster R-CNN** or **Inception-v3** are commonly used to perform this task due to their high accuracy in object detection and classification.</p>

        <h2>Calorie and Weight Estimation</h2>
        <p>Food recognition systems are not just limited to identifying food items but are also extended to estimate the portion sizes and calories. Using 3D models or image-based algorithms, the system can estimate the foodâ€™s volume and weight, which is then mapped to caloric content for dietary analysis.</p>
