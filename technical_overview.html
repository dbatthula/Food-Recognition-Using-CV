        <h2>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture</h2>
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the backbone of food recognition models. CNNs are composed of layers that allow the model to detect features in images such as edges, textures, and shapes. This architecture is particularly powerful in food image analysis as it can learn the intricate details necessary for differentiating between similar-looking food items.</p>

        <h2>Sample Images from the Food-101 Dataset</h2>
        <p>The Food-101 dataset contains over 101,000 images across 101 categories of food. These images are used for training and testing machine learning models. By learning from this diverse dataset, CNN models can generalize better to unseen food images.</p>

        <h2>Feature Extraction in CNN Layers</h2>
        <p>CNN layers extract features from food images progressively, starting from simple features like edges to more complex structures like shapes and textures. This feature extraction process is crucial in accurately identifying food items.</p>

        <h2>Activation Maps in CNNs</h2>
        <p>Activation maps visualize which parts of an image the CNN is focusing on to classify it. These maps help us understand how the model distinguishes between different food items by identifying important textures, colors, and shapes.</p>

        <h2>System Workflow for Food Recognition</h2>
        <p>The workflow for food recognition typically includes image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and output. Each step is crucial for the system to effectively recognize and classify food items.</p>
